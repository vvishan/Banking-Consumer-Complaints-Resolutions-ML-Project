# Consumer-Complaints-Resolutions-ML-Project
ML project - Predicting the Dispute Consumers


Consumer complaint resolution is important to any business. In this particular case we have been
given details consumer complaints along with whether consumer disputed with the conclusion. If
we are able to predict this , consumer likely disputed can be given more attention as to how the
complaints are handelled as well as how to convincingly convey the final conlusions to them.

Your target here is to build prediction model for column "Consumer disputed"

Training Data = 'Consumer_Complaints_train.csv'
Test Data = 'Consumer_Complaints_test_share.csv"

All the column names are sefl explanatory.You need to build your model on Train data . Test data
doesnt have response column 'Consumer disputed', you need to predict those values and submit
it a csv format. Submission CSV should resemble the file

Sample Submission = 'sample_submission.csv'

Column names ,value types should exactly match. Also number of rows in the submission csv
should be exactly same as test data. If this is not taken care of , your submission will not be
graded.
